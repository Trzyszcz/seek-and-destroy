outputX.png show STD, not SEM


takeaway from one pert experiment:
individual perturbations scaled, are more chaotic than expected, but still 
close to the quadratic fit
note, that they aren't always monotonic

also, looking at the one_pert_turbo_zoom, we can see that the hypercells are so tiny, that the numerical steps are bigger than their effect
